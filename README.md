# Simulating-Chemotaxis--Q-learning-and-Heuristic-
Chemotaxis is a complicated biological process performed by microorganisms as a means of navigation through chemical filled microscopic worlds. The code included in this repository is meant to address the question of if chemotaxis can be simulated using machine learning, and what methods of machine learning simulate the process best.
